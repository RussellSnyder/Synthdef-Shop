# Synthdef-Shop
It's like a candy shop but for supercollider scripts!  

The idea is having a website where algorithmic music composers can go to compare and quickly integrate supercollider instruments into their compositions

This project will heavily rely on having a standardized synth definition for rapid experimentation and use in larger systems like that outlines in [S4](https://github.com/RussellSnyder/S4)

## Get involved!

If you want to get involved, please do! We are looking for contributions of all kinds :-)

If you want to meet IRL come by an event of [Berlin Supercollider Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Supercollider-Hack-Learn-and-Play/)

## General Idea

It would be nice to quickly hear how a synthdef sounds and download it to use.
Synthdefs with vastly different Ugens can create similar sounds and do just by looking at the code, you may miss similarities.
By adding metadata to the synthdefs, this will allow users to find synthdefs based on timbre and use instead of simple by Ugen.
This should be more rewarding to an artist and lead to a fast art creation flow.


## Tentative plan

- [ ] Build infrastructure to allow users to upload code snippets and audio examples
- [ ] Synthdef code can be seen and users can hear presets of synth as audio files
- [ ] Synthdef code can be seen and users can hear presets of synth on local machine with scsynth running (using supercollider.js)
- [ ] MVP recommendations for synthdefs based on what you are looking at currently (static Ugen analysis for example)
- [ ] addToCart and checkout which allows users to download a zip file of synthdefs they want to use
- [ ] Establish quick way to include synthdefs in projects
- [ ] Prototype with supercollider artists and improve
- [ ] Profit?
